My Pandas Homework </br>
--------------------------------</br></br>
Ok, New update on Homework 2/28.</br></br>
The most updated file is the **panda_homework.ipynb**</br></br>
It seems that my prior homework was just code from class with nothing changed...</br>
... Sorry about that</br></br>
I was able to go back and update everything proper, and fill in some extra missed items.</br>
When it got to the part at the end, build your own portfolio, I know there were files with data</br>
that I could have used... but I kinda wanted to do crypto, and I was familiar with the code from one of </br>
our projects to pull the data from Tiingo.  I know I made the api key public, I figured it would make it </br>
easier for you :-)
</br></br>
I hope not to get penalized for going outside the instructions.
</br></br>
Thaank you!
